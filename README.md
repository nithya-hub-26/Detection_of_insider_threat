# Detection_of_insider_threat
Insider threats are a complicated and difficult problem to identify and avoid  because they mostly have privileged access to the network and database of company details. We have trained the model with only the normal behaviour so that the model finds the insider when a user data deviates from the normal behavioural data and this has been already implemented with ML methods like one-class svm, isolation forest etc but we have implemented this method in LSTM.
